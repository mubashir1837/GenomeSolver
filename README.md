# GenomeSolvers

Welcome to **GenomeSolvers**, a repository dedicated to solving bioinformatics problems and exploring algorithms related to genome analysis and pattern matching. This repository is ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to learn or implement solutions for common challenges in computational biology and string algorithms.

---

## **Features**
- Algorithms for finding frequent patterns (k-mers) in DNA sequences.
- Implementation of pattern counting and reverse complement generation.
- Solutions for overlapping pattern occurrences.
- Efficient approaches for genome sequence analysis.
- Modular Python scripts with clear documentation.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To run the programs in this repository, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook)
- Basic understanding of DNA sequences and string manipulation

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenomeSolvers.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd GenomeSolvers
   ```
3. Install required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **How to Use**

### 1. **Pattern Counting**
Run the `pattern_count.py` script to count occurrences of a specific pattern in a DNA sequence.
```bash
python pattern_count.py
```
Provide the DNA sequence and pattern when prompted.

### 2. **Finding Most Frequent k-mers**
Run the `most_frequent_kmers.py` script to find the most frequent k-mers in a sequence.
```bash
python most_frequent_kmers.py
```
Set the sequence and k-mer length in the script or as input.

### 3. **Reverse Complement**
Use `reverse_complement.py` to generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
```bash
python reverse_complement.py
```
